# QuickAlpineYAAC (ALTERNATE)
A application that allows you to quickly, launch, remove, and install yet another alpine chroot for kindle.

# Special Features/Usage
Can be installed alongside other alpines. (Exclusive to QuickAlpine ALT series)
And I quote "Clean up the toolchain from the old scripts so I can comprehend what's going on.
Base image for whatever else you want to do.
Minimize bulk for users who are going to throw their own stuff on it anyway. Don't need another DE to run neovim on your Kindle since kterm exists? Don't install it. Your next-generation™, AI-powered™, AWS-delivered™, OpenAI™-wrapping, CloudFlare™-blast-radius-prone, ncurses-based smart display project? Do it."

# Setup
1. Download QuickYAAC from the latest release
2. extract it
3. merge the documents folder with the documents folder on your kindle
4. open the kindle and run the install booklet
5. run the start booklet to initiate shell
